# Pick configuration
#
# If no config file is available, sensible defaults will be used.
# If you wish to use a config file, it must be located at ~/.pick/config.toml
#
# Variables:
# $HOME - Replaced with the path to your home directory, e.g. $HOME/.pick -> /home/john/.pick


## General
# # The general section controls general settings for pick.
# [general]
# # Specifies the length of generated passwords.
# passwordlen = 25


## Storage
# The storage section controls where the safe is stored and which storage type to use.
[storage]
type = "file"
# Whether to auto-create backups before the safe is modified.
auto_backup = true
# The number of backups to keep.
# Specify -1 to allow unlimited backups, 0 to not create backups at all.
max_backups = 100
  [storage.settings]
  path = "$HOME/.pick/pick.safe"


## Encryption
#
#    Danger Area!
#    Only uncomment / adjust the settings in the [encryption] section if you know what you are doing.
#    If you change something and we update our default (recommended) settings, your safe will
#    _not_ automatically upgrade to our new recommendations.
#    The encryption section controls the configuration of the safe encryption.
#
# [encryption]
# # type lets you specify the encryption method to use.
# # Currently supported: "openpgp", "aes_gcm".
# type = "openpgp"
#
#   [encryption.openpgp]
#   # The cipher to use, currently supported: "aes256", "aes128".
#   # The number after "aes" specifies the key length (in bits).
#   cipher = "aes256"
#   # s2kcount sets the number of iterations used to derive a key from your password.
#   # The more iterations, the longer it takes to convert your password to a key.
#   # This increases the time required for e.g. dictionary-attacks.
#   # Currently supported values: 1024-65011712 (inclusive).
#   # Not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected,
#   # the value is automatically rounded up to the nearest legal value.
#   s2kcount = 65011712
#
#   [encryption.aes_gcm]
#   # Specifies the key length (in bytes) to use for AES.
#   # Currently supported values: 32, 24, 16 for 256bit, 192bit, 128bit respectively.
#   keylen = 32
#   # The hash function to use for PBKDF2.
#   # Currently supported values: "sha512", "sha256".
#   pbkdf2hash = "sha512"
#   # The number of iterations used to derive the key from your password.
#   pbkdf2iterations = 100000
#   # Specifies the salt length (in bytes) for the PBKDF2.
#   pbkdf2saltlen = 16
